2. It is important to choose a license in order to declare what freedoms users of your project have. It also defines rules regarding how others can modify and distribute your work.

3. Projects without an explicit license automatically use the default one. On GitHub that means all rights reserved. When a project is all rights reserved, you can't modify it in any way. You can get into legal trouble if you publish a project that was modified from one with all rights reserved.

5. Linux is licensed under GPL v2 because it's goal is to make a platform made entirely of free software. GPL ensures that any anyone who distributes modified versions of its software do so for free and provide the source code so that others may also make changes.

6. MIT license because it allows users to modify it freely and we aren't working on anything so important.
