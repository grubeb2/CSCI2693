1. Why are we not using plain text files that don't enforce stupid formatting rules?

2. It is important to choose a license in order to declare what freedoms users of your project have. It also defines rules regarding how others can modify and distribute your work.

3. Projects without an explicit license automatically use the default one. On GitHub that means all rights reserved. When a project is all rights reserved, you can't modify it in any way. You can get into legal trouble if you publish a project that was modified from one with all rights reserved.

4. I agree that Gopher was done in in part by it's failure to match the development force that the Web was able to attract. Fixes and new features were more slow in the making for Gopher than for the Web, and there were fewer developers producing content for documents in Gopher.

5. Linux is licensed under GPL v2 because it's goal is to make a platform made entirely of free software. GPL ensures that any anyone who distributes modified versions of its software do so for free and provide the source code so that others may also make changes.

6. MIT license because it allows users to modify it freely and we aren't working on anything so important.

7. Apache is best for companies because allows them free use while also granting patents to contributers and users. GPL is best for developers and for the common good. It ensures that anyone can contribute to development and guarantees that changes are tracked through versions.

8. Ok. 

9. Groups that can't decide where to eat will use this app to choose a restaurant for them. Users join groups and then contribute to the group's list of possible restaurants. Then users add their preferences, like what they want to eat or where they want to go, and then the app tells them where they are going to eat.
