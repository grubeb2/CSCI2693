c3. Jesse's story is a warning to would-be developers out there looking to start their own online project. Jesse was punished because he 
didn't take the proper precautions protecting himself from legal repercussions. Jesse should have made sure that every program his search
engine utilized was licensed to allow him to do so. Though this is an important step, it would not have helped Jesse's case. What Jesse 
needed to do, and what propective software developers should do, is make end users sign a usage agreement stating that they will only use
your software for it's intended purpose, so that people like pirates get themselves in trouble while you are protected.
